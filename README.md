# Emu keyboard

Emu keyboard is an ergonomic split keyboard with 4x6 (or 3x6 if you break off the 'digits' row) column staggered keys, 
5 thumb keys, 1 key for pinky and 1 additional key for index finger. 

Emu design was inspired by
* https://github.com/foostan/crkbd - for arc-shaped thumb cluster
* https://github.com/joric/jorne - for additional key for the pinky
* https://github.com/Ladniy/jiran - for staggering and 'digits' row
* https://github.com/KGOH/Jian-Info - for placing ProMicro underneath the PCB
* https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58 - for additional key for the index finger
* https://github.com/splitkb/kyria - for additional key for the thumb
