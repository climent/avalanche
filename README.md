# Emu keyboard

Emu keyboard is an ergonomic split keyboard with 4x6 (or 3x6 if you break off the 'digits' row) column staggered keys, 
5 thumb keys, 1 key for pinky and 1 additional key for index finger. 

Emu design was inspired by
* [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) - for arc-shaped thumb cluster.
* [Jorne](https://github.com/joric/jorne), [Jiran](https://github.com/Ladniy/jiran), [Jian](https://github.com/KGOH/Jian-Info) - for additional key for the pinky.
* [ErgoTravel](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/ErgoTravel), Jian, [Redox](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) - for placing ProMicro underneath the PCB.
* [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) - for additional key for the index finger.
* [Kyria](https://github.com/splitkb/kyria) - for additional key for the thumb.

Many thanks to ErgoTravel for their super detailed [Build Instructions](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/ErgoTravel/blob/master/BuildInstructions.md) that helped me a lot.
